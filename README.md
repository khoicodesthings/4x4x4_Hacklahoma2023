# 4x4x4_Hacklahoma2023 - Hyperdrive: Dijkstra's Algorithm
Team 4x4x4 - Hacklahoma 2023 Project

## Inspiration
We are a team of Data Science student, so we wanted to showcase one of the most famous optimization algorithms for a shortest path problem: the Dijkstra's algorithm

## What it does
The tool will walk the user through the logic of the algorithm. The user can input the starting and ending planet.

## How we built it
We built the tool using Python, using the matplotlib library predominantly. Clip Studio Paint was used for the art.

## Challenges we ran into
We mostly spent our time getting the graph to highlight the correct nodes, as well as showing the appropriate values of each node. We also spent a lot of time trying to bring the Python tool into an html format. This ultimately was not completed.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We learned a lot about Python during this project as well as the new matplotlib libraries, like Text Box Widgets. 

## What we learned
We learned that it is a lot harder to bring Python into a website UI than we first thought. Most people appear to just embed python scripts into HTML. We also had a lot of trouble finding ways to show the CONSOLE  into a website format.

## What's next for Hyperdrive: Dijkstra's Algorithm
We hope that add more UI capabilities like selecting the planet from the graph rather than having the user type in the planet. We also hope to add other algorithms!
